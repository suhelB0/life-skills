# Sexual Harassment Prevention

## 1. What Conduct Qualifies as Sexual Harassment?

Any inappropriate or uninvited sexually suggestive behavior, wording, or gesture that makes someone feel uncomfortable, threatened, or degraded is considered sexual harassment. It can happen in public places, workplaces, or educational institutions. Typical instances consist of:

- **Inappropriate Comments or Jokes**: Using derogatory language, making comments about someone's appearance, or cracking sexual jokes.

- **Unwanted Physical Contact**: Any physical contact that occurs without consent, including touching, pinching, or brushing against someone, is referred to as "unwanted physical contact."

- **Sharing Offensive Content**: Sending or displaying explicit pictures, texts, or videos that could annoy or offend people is known as "sharing offensive content."

- **Sexual Advances for Personal Gain**: Asking for sexual favors in exchange for academic, professional, or personal advantages is known as "quid pro quo" harassment.

- **Creating an Intimidating Atmosphere**: Consistent actions, words, or gestures that, even when there is no direct physical contact, cause someone to feel uneasy or unsafe.

Sexual harassment can be defined as any behavior that violates someone's privacy, dignity, or sense of safety.

## 2. How Do You Respond to Sexual Harassment?

The following actions should be taken into consideration if you experience or witness any kind of sexual harassment:

- **Speak Up (If Safe)**: If you feel comfortable doing so, tell the person that their behavior is unacceptable and needs to stop.

- **Notify the Relevant Authority**: Report the issue to HR or the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in accordance with your company's PoSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) policies.

- **Record the Incident**: Keep a thorough log that includes the dates, times, locations, people involved, and any eyewitnesses.

- **Reach Out for Support**: Talk about your experience with counselors, mentors, or close friends who can provide both practical guidance and emotional support.

- **Escalate if Needed**: Seek additional action from legal authorities or external grievance redressal forums if the matter cannot be resolved internally.

Everyone has the right to live and work in a respectful, safe environment. Taking timely and appropriate action contributes to that safety.
