# Software Development Best Practices

## 1. Important Lessons from Every Section

1. **Ask Questions Up Front**  
   Since it may be difficult to get everyone together again, it is best to address any questions you may have during meetings.

2. **Disclose Any Modifications to the Deadline**  
   Notify your team as soon as possible of any changes to the requirements or deadlines.

3. **Clearly Describe Problems**  
   Clearly explain the problem and your previous attempts to resolve it when you're stuck.

4. **Make Time for Team & Product** The fourth step is to make time for both the team and the product. It fosters improved trust and communication.

5. **Respect Others’ Time** Modify your communication style according to the circumstance—in certain cases, a message is preferable to a phone call.

6. **Focus Fully**  
    Maintain your focus while working. Enjoy every moment of your break. The key is balance.

My goal is to improve my communication skills. What I intend to do is as follows:

- **Ask Questions**: Express curiosity and make sure you understand by posing follow-up queries.  
- **Be Clear**: Write and speak in an easy-to-understand manner to make myself understood by others.  
- **Get Feedback**: To get feedback, ask friends or teammates how I can do better and follow their advice.  
- **Read & Write More**: This will improve my ability to articulate ideas and expand my vocabulary.  
- **Attend Workshops**: To learn and practice communication techniques, enroll in workshops or courses.
